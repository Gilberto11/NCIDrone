# NCIDrone
Project for College, trying to build an autonomous drone from scratch. I was not using Git from the very beggining as I planned to submit all the code in a zipped folder, but then college asked for a link of the repo so I pushed everything in one go. Only started to commit and push code to this repo from the moment the college notified that they wanted only a link.
